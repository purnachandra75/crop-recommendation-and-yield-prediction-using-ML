            <p>The common grape (Vitis vinifera) is grown to make wine and is European in origin.It is also known as the "European grape" and "wine grape."</p>
            <p>There are thousands of varieties of Vitis vinifera, although only a small portion of these are commercially important. On the other hand, a large portion of popular grape wine is produced from cultivars of this species. While primarily thought of as wine grapes, the fruits can also be dried to make raisins. This species yields inferior table grapes, however, and is not commonly used for this purpose commercially.
                <br>
                Like many vines that climb, the wine grapes bear clasping tendrils that help keep the vines off the ground. Leaves are held on long stalks and have three to seven lobes. Each leaf has coarsely toothed edges and the undersides bear tiny hairs. The fruits (berries) vary in size, shape, and color. The vines have a rapid growth rate and are best planted in early spring.</p>

                <h1>Common Grape Care</h1>
				<p>Growing requirements can vary considerably, depending on the variety or cultivar selected, so it will pay off to do your research before planting. Here are the main care requirements for growing Common Grape:</p>
                <p></p><h3>Light</h3> <br>The common grape needs full sun to bear the best possible crop. Vines planted on a gentle southeast facing slope often tend to produce well.<p></p>
                <p></p><h3>Soil</h3><br>In keeping with its native Mediterranean roots, the common grape requires well-drained soil. It will also appreciate a location that has loamy soil rich in organic matter. It prefers a pH around 6.5.<p></p>
                <p></p><h3>Water</h3><br>Give your crop adequate but not excessive water. Irrigate well during periods of drought. The ground should be kept evenly moist. Providing good drainage is an important first step in preventing overwatering.<p></p>
                <p></p><h3>Temperature and Humidity</h3><brvitis vinifera="" varieties="" are="" known="" for="" being="" less="" cold-hardy="" than="" american="" grape="" species,="" so="" they="" usually="" do="" best="" in="" regions="" with="" hardiness="" zones="" of="" 6="" and="" above.="" some="" varieties,="" however,="" more="" others.="" generally,="" need="" a="" long,="" warm="" climate="" to="" produce="" good="" harvest.p="">
                <p></p><h3>Fertilizer</h3><br>Apply the fertilizer no closer to the base of the plant than one foot. It is better to spread it across the area that lies four to five feet away from the base in all directions. This practice promotes superior root development.<p></p>
                <p></p>

                <h1>Types of Vitis Vinifera</h1>
                <p>Although there are thousands of Vitis vinifera varieties, a limited number of these are used for wine production. They are ones that work well in specific regional climates and produce palatable wines.

Just a handful of the many popular common grape varieties that are suited to being grown in North America are outlined below. Do your research, though, as there are lots to choose from and much will depend on your region's growing conditions and what type of wine you enjoy. Specific varieties produce red or white wines with a wide range of characteristics that influence taste and flavor.</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><b>Chardonnay:</b>This white wine grape, originally from France, is more cold-hardy than many other Vitis vinifera varieties and this makes it easier to grow in a wider number of North American regions. It produces an early and reliable fruit but is highly susceptible to Botrytis bunch rot.
</li>
                    <li><b>Pinot blanc:</b> Originating in Germany, this white wine grape is similarly cold-hardy to Chardonnay, but is not as plagued by problems with Botrytis bunch rot.</li>
                    <li><b>Cabernet sauvignon:</b>This popular red grape variety is also known for being more cold-hardy and disease resistant than many of its relatives. Wine quality can vary, however, and the best results are achieved in warmer regions</li>
                    <li><b>Pinot noir:</b> Known for producing high-quality red table wines, this variety ripens early and is relatively cold-hardy. Unfortunately, it is another one that can be impacted adversely by bunch rot. Careful vine management in terms of pruning and air circulation is needed to produce a successful crop.
</li>
                </ul>

                <h1>Pruning</h1>
                <p>Spacing, pruning, and training the vines adequately are vitally important to produce a good crop and reduce incidences of fungus-based diseases. Most grape varieties will need several seasons before bearing a harvestable crop. Here again, it is important to do the research in order to learn about viable arboring and staking systems and appropriate pruning techniques for the first few years of growth. While the vines can grow up to 60 feet, they are usually pruned to 3â€“9 ft. high, with a similar spread, for wine production.</p>
				<h2>Propagating Common Grapes</h2>
                <ul>
                    <li>Take a year-old growth cutting and cut measured to 12 inches long with a few buds on it.</li>
                    <li>Dip the cutting in rooting hormone and place in moist but not saturated soil.</li>
                    <li>Cover the cutting with clear plastic bag to retain moisture and place it in a spot with bright indirect light, but not full sun.</li>
                    <li>Check it daily and keep soil moist.</li>
					<li>In a few weeks, when the cutting shows new growth, move it outside to a protected area for a week or two, protecting it from full sun, before transplanting it to its permanent location.</li>
                </ul>
                <p></p>

                <h1>     Common Pests and Diseases  </h1>
                <p>The myriad diseases and insect pests that attack the common grape make growing it a high-maintenance operation. Give your vines ample spacing to ensure good air circulation. This is important for disease control. The common grape is notoriously prone to diseases, which include anthracnose, Black rot, Botrytis bunch rot, mold diseases, and powdery mildew.

The common grape also is susceptible to numerous insects (commercial growers must spray their vineyards to prevent infestations from these pests), including flea beetles, grape berry moths, Japanese beetles, leafhoppers, and mealybugs.

As the vines mature and begin to produce fruit, it may become necessary to provide netting to prevent birds and other wildlife from devouring your hard-won crop.
