                <h1>How to Plant mothbeans</h1>
                <p>Growing moth bean is popular in some parts of India. And it is generally grown in arid and semi-arid regions with extreme weather and fewer rains.

The moth bean is drought-resistant, the plants can be grown on many soil types and it is an important pulse crop of arid and semi-arid regions of India and Pakistan.

The moth bean (Vigna aconitifolia) is an herbaceous creeping annual plant which grows to approximately 40 cm high.

The yellow flowers on the hairy and densely packed branches of the moth bean plant develop into yellow-brown pods, measuring about 2-3 inches in length.

The pods generally holds 4 to 9 seeds inside. And the seeds are rectangular and come in a variety of colors including, yellow-brown, whitish green and mottled with black. The moth bean seeds are very high in protein, containing up to 22-24 percent protein.

The moth bean plants are highly drought-resistant, and they can create a low-lying soil cover when fully grown.

The moth bean has been identified as possibly a more significant food source in the future due to it’s drought resistant qualities, ability to combat soil erosion and it’s high protein content.</p>

                <p><h3>Light</h3> <br/></p>
                <p><h3>Soil</h3><br/>The moth beans are not picky about soil types, they can be grown in a wide variety of soil types. The plants can tolerate slight salinity and has a wide pH range, typically 3.5 to 10.</p>
                <p><h3>Water</h3><br/>Although the moth bean plants are very hardy and drought tolerant, they will do fine if they are irrigated adequately and timely. Watering especially during the flowering and pod developing stages will be very good for the plants.</p>
                <p><h3>Temperature and Humidity</h3><br/></p>
                <p><h3>Fertilizer</h3><br/>The moth bean plants don’t require applying additional fertilizer.</p>

                <h1>Harvesting</h1>
                <p>The moth bean plants generally take between 75 and 90 days from planting to harvesting.Harvesting moth bean is pretty difficult, and it’s the main drawback to this crop.You have to cut the plants with a sickle, because you can’t use mowers mainly due to the shape and density of the moth bean’s branches.Then after cutting, it is threshed and winnowed after being dried for approximately one week.</p>

                <h1>     Common Pests and Diseases           </h1>
                <p>Moth bean is impacted by Mungbean yellow mosaic virus, for which silverleaf whitefly is the vector.Root rot and seedling blight from Macrophomina phaseolina also causes damage, as well as some Striga species and the nematode Meloidogyne incognita.Cultivating some resistant cultivars will be very helpful for preventing most of the pests and diseases. Also keep good contact with any of your local expert or agriculture specialist.</p>
