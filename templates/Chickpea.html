            <h1>How to Grow  chickpeas </h1>
          <p>What we call chickpeas or garbanzo beans are legumes, but they aren’t botanically peas (Pisum sativum). The annual plants are bushy and short. Like tomatoes, chickpeas are indeterminate, they continue to grow new leaves after they have started to flower—in purple, white, pink, or blue color depending on the chickpea variety. The chickpeas grow in small seed pods. They are green when fresh though most chickpeas are harvested after the seeds have dried on the plant and turned tan or brown in color. Chickpeas are widely used in Mediterranean, Middle Eastern, and Indian cuisine.</p>

                <h1>How to Plant Chickpeas</h1>
                <p>Chickpeas are planted when the soil temperature in the spring has warmed up to at least 50 degrees F. After that, they need a long, warm growing season. If you live in a cold climate, you should get a head start on the outdoor growing season to increase the chance that the plants reach maturity before the end of the summer. Start chickpea seeds indoors two to four weeks before your average last frost date, as long as you use coir or paper pots that let you transplant them into the garden without disturbing the roots.</p></div>

                <h1>Chickpeas Care</h1>
                <p><h3>Light</h3> <br/>Chickpeas need a spot that gets 6 to 8 hours of sun daily. In hot southern climates, the plants do better with afternoon shade.</p>
                <p><h3>Soil</h3><br/>The soil should be nutrient-rich with plenty of organic matter and have excellent drainage. Chickpeas grow in a pH range from 5.3 to 7, around 6.0 is ideal.</p>
                <p><h3>Water</h3><br/>To grow chickpeas, the soil needs to be evenly moist at all times. If it does not rain, give the plants about an inch of water per week in areas with moderately warm summers. In hot climates, they need more water until the top 2 inches of soil feel moist. Water the plants slowly and deeply to reach the root. Drip irrigation is best. </p>
                <p><h3>Temperature and Humidity</h3><br/>Chickpeas need warm weather but they are not a hot-weather crop, they thrive in daytime temperatures between 70 and 80 degrees F and nighttime temperatures between 65 to 70 degrees F. Moderate humidity does not bother the plants. In cool climates, an early fall frost cuts the growing season short if the chickpeas haven’t fully matured yet.</p>
                <p><h3>Fertilizer</h3><br/>Chickpeas are nitrogen-fixing legumes so any fertilizer you apply should be high in phosphorus, potassium, and micronutrients yet not in nitrogen, which promotes foliage growth. If you start with rich, fertile soil, you might not need a fertilizer at all. To avoid overfertilizing, lightly sprinkle some granular organic fertilizer in a circle around the plants every six weeks, taking care not to get fertilizer on the stems.

                <h1> chickpeas Varieties</h1>
                <p>The two main types of chickpeas are Kabuli and Desi:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><b>'Kabuli'</b>are small- to large-seeded chickpeas and these plants usually are taller than Desi. Kabuli chickpeas have white to cream-colored seed coats and white flowers..</li>
                    <li><b>'Desi'</b>chickpeas are small and have a tan or brown pigmented seed coat. Desi chickpeas have purple flowers and they mature a week or two earlier than Kabuli chickpeas.

                <h1>Harvesting</h1>
                <p>Depending on the weather conditions, chickpeas are ready to be harvested in 85 to 100 days after planting, in the late summer. You can harvest them when the pods are still small and green and prepare them like snap beans.</p>
                <p>The most common way of harvesting them is waiting for the leaves to wither, dry, and brown, then pull the entire plant including the roots. Place the plant on a flat surface in a warm, dry, well-ventilated location such as a garage. Let it dry further until the pods start to split and the seeds inside are visible. Remove the seeds from their pods.</p>

                <h1>     Common Pests and Diseases           </h1>
        <p>Like other legumes, chickpeas are prone to fungal diseases such as Ascochyta blight, Rhizoctonia root rot, Pythium rot, Fusarium wilt, white mold, bacterial blight, as well as certain viruses which are transmitted by aphids. These diseases are often exacerbated by high humidity, hot temperatures, and lots of rain.1 Prevent spreading problems with proper plant spacing to ensure air circulation and avoid overhead watering.</p>
