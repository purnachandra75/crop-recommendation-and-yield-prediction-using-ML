            <h1>How a Coconut Trees Grow </h1>
			<p>Coconut palm trees grow at a moderate rate of 1 to 2 feet per year, adding a gentle curve above the slightly thickened base of the trunk as they mature. The crown features 25 to 30 large fronds up to 18 feet long and 6 feet wide, each with 200 leaflets that are 2 feet long. One new frond is produced each month as the oldest one is shed; each frond lasts up to three years. Only trees grown outdoors produce fruit.</p>
            <h1>When to Plant</h1>
 <p>If you're looking to transport yourself to the beach—even if only in your mind—then consider growing a coconut palm (Cocos nucifera) indoors. But a word of warning: This plant is fairly finicky to keep unless you live in its natural climate.

Native to islands in the Western Pacific, the coconut palm is probably what comes to mind for many when you say the phrase "palm tree." These trees thrive in warm, humid environments around the world. Thus, it's important to give your palm as much sunlight and warmth as possible when growing it indoors, along with ample humidity and moist but not soggy soil. Coconut palms also need regular fertilization.</p>
                <br/>
               <h1>Selecting a Planting Site</h1>
<p>An ideal planting site for cilantro should have loose, well-drained soil. It can handle either full sun or partial shade but tends to prefer some afternoon shade in warmer climates. Make sure cilantro isn’t planted too close to taller plants that will shade it as they leaf out in the spring. Container growth also is a good option for cilantro.</p>

                <h1>How to Plant coconut</h1>
                <p> Sprouted coconuts can be potted in 3-gallon containers with about 12 inches of soil. Their root balls are fairly small and shallow to start, and as a result, they don't need a lot of soil in the early growing months. However, once your coconut palm's roots grow to be about 6 to 8 inches long, repot the plant into a vessel that holds at least 10 gallons of soil. A clay container with ample drainage holes is best to allow excess soil moisture to escape through the container walls and bottom..</p>

                <h1>coconut Care</h1>
                <p><h3>Light</h3> <br/>Coconut palms thrive in full sun, meaning at least six hours of direct sunlight on most days. Even palms found in nature can struggle in the shade, so it's extremely important that any indoor coconut palm receives ample sunshine. Depending on its placement in your home, consider moving your plant's location throughout the day to "chase" the sun and ensure proper exposure.</p>
                <p><h3>Soil</h3><br/>A loose, loamy, fast-draining soil with a slightly acidic soil pH is best for cilantro. Too much retained moisture in the soil can cause the plant to bolt early.</p>
                <p><h3>Water</h3><br/>Keep the soil evenly moist but not soggy as seeds germinate and seedlings develop. Roughly 1 inch of water per week is ideal for seedlings. More mature plants don’t require as much water, but they still like moist soil. Just make sure their roots are never waterlogged.

</p>
                <p><h3>Temperature and Humidity</h3><br/>Coconut palms prefer temperatures that are at least 70 degrees Fahrenheit. They grow best in temperatures between 85- and 95-degrees Fahrenheit and they might fail to thrive if the temperature dips below 64 degrees Fahrenheit. High humidity is an important factor, too. Maintain a moist environment for your palm with the addition of an in-room humidifier, as well as frequent spritzing of the plant with warm water. You also can keep the container on a tray of pebbles and water to raise the humidity around the plant. Just make sure the bottom of the container isn't touching the </p>
                <p><h3>Fertilizer</h3><br/>Feed your palm year-round with a liquid fertilizer. Coconut palms are known to have several nutrient deficiencies, including a lack of phosphorus, nitrogen, manganese, and boron. So seek out a fertilizer blend specifically made for palm trees to supplement these losses, and follow label instructions for the amount and freq.</p>

                <p>Let your coconut palm enjoy the heat and sunlight for as long as possible. When temperatures begin to dip below 64 degrees Fahrenheit or so, it's time to bring the tree in to avoid damage.</p>

                <p>Coconut palms are used to growing in a variety of soil conditions and are therefore not terribly picky about their planting mixture. That said, soil that closely mimics the coconut palm's natural environment is always best. A well-draining palm soil mix works well for potted coconut palms. Additionally, you can add a layer of mulch to the top of the soil to help it retain moisture..</p>
