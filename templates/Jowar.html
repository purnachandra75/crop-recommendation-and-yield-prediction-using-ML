            <h1>where to Grow Jowar</h1>
			<p>Rocky fields should be avoided for Jowar farming. The field should be ploughed one to two times, followed by two crosswise harrowings to prepare a good seedbed for Jowar cultivation. The field should be well drained because water logging is not suitable for Jowar farming.</p>
            <P>Sorghum or jowar is one of the vital food and fodder cereal crops. The nutritional value of sorghum is the same as that of corn, which is why it is gaining importance as livestock feed. Sorghum (or) Jowar is also used for ethanol production, producing grain alcohol, starch production, production of adhesives and paper other than food and feed for livestock. Jowar (or) Sorghum cultivation is gaining popularity due to its nature of extreme drought tolerance. Sorghum is very nutritious, just like corn, and can be used as green fodder, dry fodder, hay, or silag</P>

                <h1>How to Plant jowar</h1>
                <p> Single-cut varieties should be picked at the boot stage 70 to 90 days after sowing. If the variety can be cut many times, the initial cut should be made 55 to 60 days after seeding, and further cuttings can be taken every 45 to 50 days.

                <h1>Jowar Care</h1>
                <p><h3>Light</h3> <br/>Single-cut varieties should be picked at the boot stage 70 to 90 days after sowing. If the variety can be cut many times, the initial cut should be made 55 to 60 days after seeding, and further cuttings can be taken every 45 to 50 days.

</p>
                <p><h3>Soil</h3><br/>Sorghum crop adapts the wide range of soils but grows well in sandy loam soils having good drainage. Soil pH range of 6 to 7.5 is ideal for its cultivation and better growth. The main field should be plowed and leveled to a fine tilth for weeds-free sowing.</p>
                <p><h3>Water</h3><br/>Keep the soil evenly moist but not soggy as seeds germinate and seedlings develop. Roughly 1 inch of water per week is ideal for seedlings. More mature plants don’t require as much water, but they still like moist soil. Just make sure their roots are never waterlogged.

</p>
                <p><h3>Temperature and Humidity</h3><br/>Basically, jowar or sorghum is a tropical crop. Sorghum thrives well at temperatures between 25°C and 32°C but below 16°C is not good for the crop. Jowar crop requires rainfall of about 40 cm annually. Jowar is an extreme drought-tolerant crop and recommended for dry regions. Too many moist and prolonged dry conditions are not suitable for sorghum cultivation.</p>
                <p><h3>Fertilizer</h3><br/>For 1 Hectare of land; FYM (Farm Yard Manure) – 10­-15 tone. At the time of sowing, basal application of;N – 60 Kg. 
P2O5 – 40 kg. 
K2O – 40 kg.</p>

                <h1>Harvesting</h1>
				<p>The crop will be ready in single cut varieties for harvesting @ 65 to 75 days after sowing (50%, flowering stage).
In multi-cut varieties, the first cut should be done @ 45­-50 days, and subsequent cuts should be carried at 1-month intervals.

                <h1>     Common Pests and Diseases           </h1>
                <p>Sorghum crops are prone to many insects and diseases. Insects/pests in sorghum are stem borer, shootfly, & sorghum midge.

Use spray of carbofuran/malathion @ 125 ml/ha, to control sorghum midge
Use a spray of endosulfan @ 0.075. Diseases in Sorghum are Sooty stripe, anthracnose and zonate leaf spot.
Spray carbendazim @ 5 grams /litre water to control anthracnose disease in early stages.</p>
