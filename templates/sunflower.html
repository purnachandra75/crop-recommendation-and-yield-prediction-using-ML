            <p>The sunflower gets its name from looking just like a soft, fuzzy, huggable stuffed toy. The versatility of this short, two- to three-foot tall sunflower cultivar with its extra large, double, golden blooms gives it equal weight no matter where you plant it. It stands out in the vegetable garden, flower beds, decorative borders and even grown in patio pots.

</p>
            <p>This is an annual sunflower that grows on sturdy stems with broad, dark green leaves. Seeds that are collected, saved, and grown the next growing season produce an identical plant and flower. Bloom time extends from mid-summer up until first frost attracting bees, butterflies and birds to the garden. Flower petals and seeds are edible and the blooms are a great cut flower addition for vases and bouquets.
                <br/>
                Modern watermelon cultivars are categorized into four groups:</p>
                
                    <ul><li>Picnic melons are jumbo-sized, 15 to 50 pounds.</li></ul>
                    <ul><li>Icebox melons are smaller family-sized fruits, 5 to 15 pounds.</li></ul>
                    <ul><li>Seedless melons are hybrids bred to be self-sterile. They weigh 10 to 20 pounds.</li></ul>
                    <ul><li>Yellow/orange-fleshed melons are often considered to be sweeter than red and pink watermelons.</li></ul>
                

            <P>Sunflowers generally planted from seeds sown directly into the garden as soon as the soil warms to 70 degrees Fahrenheit. In cool regions with short growing seasons, seeds are started indoors two to four weeks before last frost date. Most watermelons take 80 to 90 days to mature, although there are short-season varieties are ready to harvest about 70 days after the seedlings sprout.</P>

                <h1>How to Plant sunflower</h1>
                <p>Sunflowers are extremely easy to grow from seed and germinate reliably once soil temperature reach between 70 and 85 degrees Fahrenheit. Direct sowing is the recommended method although seedlings can be successfully transplanted if they are small, around two inches tall. Plan to sow seed when temperatures reach 60 to 70 degrees Fahrenheit. which is usually three weeks after final frost in temperate zones. Gather your seeds and a small hand trowel or hoe, and follow these steps:     </p>
                <p> Some growers recommend soaking seed in room temperature water for 8 to 12 hours before sowing. This might accelerate germination by a few days but seeds do not require soaking to sprout.</p>

                <p>Dig a shallow trench 1/2-inch deep. Place seeds two inches apart with the pointed part down. Cover with 1/2 inch of soil. Alternatively you can use your finger to press seeds into the soil about 1/2 inch deep. Seedlings sprout in two to three weeks..</p>
                <div style="background-color: aqua;"><p><h3>Tip:</h3>Seedless watermelon plants should be interplanted with regular seeded watermelon plants, to allow for the pollination necessary for fruit production.</p></div>

                <h1>sunflower Care</h1>
                <p><h3>Light</h3> <br/>sunflower needs full sun; a six to eight hours of bright, direct sunlight daily. All sunflowers are heliotropic, which means they track the movement of the sun. If you watch the large showy flowers throughout the day you will see the flowerheads turn to directly face the sun..</p>
                <p><h3>Soil</h3><br/>Sunflowers are not fussy about soil type but the soil must be well-draining. They perform better in organically rich soil with a slightly acidic soil pH level between 6.0 to 6.8. Working compost in before planting supports vigorous health and bigger, longer lasting blooms .</p>
                <p><h3>Water</h3><br/>sunflowers need one inch of water weekly depending on rainfall amounts and soil conditions. Avoid overwatering as this can lead to root rot and cause stems to become unstable. When the top two inches of soil become dry, thoroughly drench plants at ground level until soil is moist to six inches deep.

When grown in containers, water this dwarf sunflower at least once or twice per week..</p>
                <p><h3>Temperature and Humidity</h3><br/>Sunflowers begin to put on a show when temperatures reach between 70 and 78 degrees Fahrenheit. They can withstand higher temperatures if the soil doesn't dry out. Seeds should be collected before temperatures drop below freezing. Average humidity levels are adequate.</p>
                <p><h3>Fertilizer</h3><br/>When grown in fertile soil, the 'Teddy Bear' sunflower won't need fertilizer. If you're growing this cultivar in containers or just want to give your plants a boost, start by adding compost or a balanced, granular fertilizer such as NPK 10-10-10 before planting. For potted plants, or if garden soil is not fertile, apply a balanced liquid fertilizer once a month throughout the growing season.</p>
                <p>If you choose to use chemical fertilizer, feed early with a fertilizer that contains more nitrogen than phosphorus and potassium, since this will encourage the growth of the leaves and vine. But after flowering begins, fertilize a second time with a low-nitrogen fertilizer that encourages growth of flowers and fruit.</p>

                <h1>Watermelon Varieties</h1>
                <p>Early/ short-season varieties mature in 70 to 75 days:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><b>'Blacktail Mountain'</b>has red flesh with a dark green rind. They weigh 6 to 12 pounds.</li>
                    <li><b>'Faerie'</b>produces watermelons with red flesh and a yellow rind. They are relatively small fruits, at 5 to 6 pounds.</li>
                    <li><b>'Golden Crown'</b>watermelons have red flesh and yellow rinds. They weigh 4 to 7 pounds.</li>
                    <li><b>'Sugar Baby'</b>is a great red-fleshed cultivar. Melons weigh 6 to 10 pounds.</li>
                </ul>
                <p>Long-season varieties mature in 80 to 85 days: </p>
                <ul>
                    <li><b>'Ali Baba'</b>has oblong-shaped melons with red flesh. Melons weigh 12 to 30 pounds.</li>
                    <li><b>'Moon and Stars'</b>is a hybrid plant with beautiful melons. Both red- and yellow-fleshed cultivars are available.</li>
                    <li><b>'New Queen'</b>has orange-fleshed melons with few seeds and a high sugar content. They weigh 5 to 6 pounds.</li>
                </ul>
                <p><h3>Seedless varieties:</h3> So-called seedless varieties are not truly seedless, but the seeds are small, white, and edible. These are self-sterile hybrids. Seedless watermelons have a lower germination rate and they are more expensive than seeded watermelons, so starting them in peat or paper pots will give you a slight edge over starting them in the ground.               </p>
                <ul>
                    <li><b>'Revolution'</b>is a red-fleshed melon that matures in 80 days. Melons are 20 to 26 pounds.</li>
                    <li><b>'Superseedless' </b>has red-fleshed melons that are ready to harvest 90 to 95 days after sprouting. Melons are 16 to 20 pounds.</li>
                    <li><b>'Sweet Bite'</b>has red-fleshed melons that are ready to harvest in about 75 days. Melons are 5 to 8 pounds.</li>
                    <li><b>'Triple Gold' </b>is a yellow-fleshed melon that matures in about 75 days. Fruits way 8 to 10 pounds.</li>
                </ul>

                <h1>Potting and Repotting Sunflower</h1>
                <p>If you plan to grow 'Teddy Bear' sunflowers in containers, choose terra cotta or plastic pots. Use six inch seed starting pots with with good drainage. Follow these steps:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Soak seeds in lukewarm water for 8 to 10 hours before planting. This step is optional.</li>
                    <li>Fill pots with lightly moistened potting mix..</li>
                    <li>Plant three to four seeds 1/2 inch deep with the pointed side down, lightly cover with soil, and water..</li>
					<li>Place container(s) in a sunny location and keep soil moist but not soggy. Seedlings emerge in two to three weeks.</li>
                    <li>Once two sets of leaves appear and seedlings are sturdy enough to handle, separate the seedlings and transplant them into individual 12 inch diameter pots to give them enough room to reach their mature height and width.</li>
                </ul>
                <p>Watermelons are best eaten right away. Cut watermelon should be refrigerated and only keeps for a few days. Don't store uncut melons in the refrigerator. Opt for a cool room (45 to 50 degrees Fahrenheit), if possible. In this environment, uncut melons will keep for up to two weeks.</p>
