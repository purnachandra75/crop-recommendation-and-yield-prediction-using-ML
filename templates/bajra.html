            <p>Pearl Millet is commonly known as bajra. It is a profoundly nutritious and easy to digest cereal grain. Being non-glutinous makes it a healthy option for people with a gluten allergy and celiac disease. They are power-packed with carbohydrates, essential amino acids, antioxidants, multiple vitamins like thiamine, riboflavin, folic acid, niacin, beta carotene, and minerals like iron, phosphorus, magnesium, and zinc.</p>

                <h1>How to Plant bajra</h1>
                <p>In India, it is grown in three seasons</p>
                <p><h3>Kharif-</h3><br/> June-October(rainfed)</p>
				<p><h3> Winter-</h3><br/>November-February(rainfed)</p>
				<p><h3>Summer-</h3><br/> March-June</p>
                <div style="background-color: aqua;"><p><h3>Tip:</h3>Row spacing of 40-45cm should be maintained.
																	Plant to Plant spacing of 10-12cm should be maintained.
																	Depth should be 2-3 cm.</p></div>

                <h1>bajra Care</h1>
                <p><h3>soil</h3> <br/> It is grown in wide variety of soil.
										It grows best in black cotton soil, sandy loam soil which has good drainage system.
										Acidic and water logging soil is not preferred.
										For its cultivation, avoid saturated soil.
										The crop grows well in soil with low pH range.
										It is sensitive to acidic soil.</p>
                
                <p><h3>Water</h3><br/> It is a highly drought tolerant crop and water requirement is 300-350mm.
										Irrigation at available soil moisture of 50% or ideal IW/CPE ratio 0.4 is sufficient.
										Tillering and flowering are critical stages.
										For panicle initiation three irrigations can be recommended, flag leaf and flowering in addition to sowing irrigation under limited moisture conditions.
										Normally 5 irrigations are recommended.
										Summer irrigated pearl millet requires 6 irrigations for high yields.</p>
                <p><h3>Temperature and Humidity</h3><br/>• It grows best in warm and dry conditions.
														It is a drought tolerant crop which requires low annual rainfall of 40cm-60cm.
														Optimum temperature for its cultivation is 20°c-30°c.
														During its vegetable growth, moist weather is very beneficial.
														Bajra is grown as Kharif crop in North India and in southern parts it is known as Summer crop under irrigation.</p>
                <p><h3>Fertilizer</h3><br/> If one is cultivating commercial hybrid Bajra, even Bajra needs few nutrients.
											Application of 10-15 tonnes of compost or farm yard manure per hectare is required for requirement of fertilizer of local varieties of Pearl millet.
											For maximum profit on the basis of soil test value, fertilizer should be given.
											Almost 3-5cm below the seed, half dose of nitrogen and full doses of phosphorus and potassium should be applied.
											Foliar spray of 3% urea is also recommended in barani conditions.</p>

                <h1>Harvesting</h1>
                <p></p>
					<li> When grains become hardy and also contain moisture, the crop is ready to harvest.</li>
					<li>Cutting earhead or cutting entire plants by sticks are 2 methods that can be followed in harvesting.</li>
					<li>For 4-5 days in the sun stalk the cut plants for drying grains.</li>
					<li>By beating the earheads, grains can be separated.</li>
				<p><h3>yield</h3>Grain-23-35 qtl/ha, Fodder-100-120 qtl/ha, Under Irrigated condition. Grain-12-15 qtl/ha, Fodder-70-75 qtl/ha, Under rainfed condition.</p>
