            <p>The common grape (Vitis vinifera) is grown to make wine and is European in origin.It is also known as the "European grape" and "wine grape."</p>
            <p>The coffee plant (Coffea arabica) with its glossy green leaves and compact growth habit makes a surprisingly good potted indoor plant, even before it reaches maturity and flowers. In ideal growing conditions, after three to five years. small fragrant white flowers in the spring are followed by half-inch fruits called cherries that gradually darken from green to blackish pods. Each cherry contains two coffee beans.
                <br/>
                Like many vines that climb, the wine grapes bear clasping tendrils that help keep the vines off the ground. Leaves are held on long stalks and have three to seven lobes. Each leaf has coarsely toothed edges and the undersides bear tiny hairs. The fruits (berries) vary in size, shape, and color. The vines have a rapid growth rate and are best planted in early spring.</p>

                <h1>Cotton Rose Care</h1>
				<p>Cotton rose can provide lots of drama in the landscape, yet it requires minimal maintenance. It’s not overly picky about its soil as long as there’s good drainage, and it can tolerate some drought. It’s even known to be deer-resistant. </p>
                <p><h3>Light</h3> <br/>For best growth, plant your cotton rose in a spot that gets full sun, meaning at least six hours of direct sunlight on most days. The shrub also can tolerate partial shade, though it might not flower as profusely. </p>
                <p><h3>Soil</h3><br/>This shrub can grow in most soils with good drainage. But it does best in a loamy soil that’s rich in organic matter. A neutral to slightly alkaline soil pH is ideal. </p>


</p>
                <p><h3>Water</h3><br/>While cotton rose can tolerate some drought, it’s best to maintain a moderate amount of moisture during the growing season. A good rule of thumb is to water when the top 2 inches of soil dry out. Water minimally during the winter—just enough to prevent the soil from fully drying out. Try to avoid getting the foliage wet when watering, as this can promote fungal growth.</p>
                <p><h3>Temperature and Humidity</h3><br/>This is not a cold-hardy shrub. Frost will cause it to drop its leaves in the fall and enter dormancy. Then, it can tolerate temperatures slightly below freezing over the winter, but anything colder might damage or kill the shrub. Humidity typically isn’t a factor as long as adequate soil moisture and good air circulation around the shrub are maintained.</p>
                <p><h3>Fertilizer</h3><br/>Fertilizer isn't essential unless you have poor soil, but it can help to speed growth. Use a balanced fertilizer during the growing season, following label instructions.</p>

                <h1>Types of Vitis Vinifera</h1>
                <p>Although there are thousands of Vitis vinifera varieties, a limited number of these are used for wine production. They are ones that work well in specific regional climates and produce palatable wines.

Just a handful of the many popular common grape varieties that are suited to being grown in North America are outlined below. Do your research, though, as there are lots to choose from and much will depend on your region's growing conditions and what type of wine you enjoy. Specific varieties produce red or white wines with a wide range of characteristics that influence taste and flavor.</p>
                <ul> 
</li>
                    <li><b>Cotton Rose Nagoya:</b> This cultivar features white flowers.</li>
                    <li><b>Plenus:</b> This cultivar is known for its double blooms.</li>
                    <li><b>Rubra:</b>Red flowers are the trademark of this cultivar.</li>

                </ul>

                <h1>Pruning</h1>
                <p>Prune your cotton rose in the late winter or early spring. Remove any damaged or diseased stems as they arise. Usually only a light pruning is necessary to shape growth. But if your shrub has become leggy and unsightly, you can cut it back almost to the ground. New shoots will quickly grow to fill in the space.
</p>
				<h2>Propagating Coffee Plants</h2>
                <ul>
                    <li>Use sterile pruners to cut an 8- to 10-inch stem. Remove all but a pair of upper leaves.</li>
                    <li>Dip the cut end in rooting hormone.</li>
					<li>Fill a 4-inch pot with damp potting mix. Insert the cutting deeply into the soil.</li>
                    <li>Cover the cutting with a clear plastic dome or plastic bag. Place it in a warm location but out of direct sunlight. Keep it evenly moist.</li>
                    <li>When you can gently tug on the plant and feel resistance, you'll know roots have formed. Remove the cover and place it in a location with partial sun</li>
					<li>As the plant grows in size, repot it into a larger pot.</li>
                </ul>
                <p></p>

                <h1>     Common Pests and Diseases  </h1>
                <p>Cotton rose is susceptible to some common garden pests, including aphids, mealybugs, whiteflies, spider mites, and scale. Infestations often can be treated with insecticidal soaps or even a strong spray of water. 

Common diseases include leaf spot, southern stem blight, and powdery mildew. Remove any stems with signs of fungal growth. Also, aim to prevent fungal diseases by watering only at the base of the plant and maintaining good air flow around it.
