                <p><h3>Water</h3><br/> Adequate and timely watering is very important for growing kidney bean plants. Several irrigation are required during the growing season. First watering on 25th day after sowing the seeds, and then 3 irrigation at 25 days interval are necessary for getting maximum yield. Watering prior to blooming, during flowering and at the pod development stage is very important.</p>

                <p>Depending on the variety, the kidney bean crop will be ready for harvesting within 120-130 days. You can expect to harvest when the pods are fully grown and ripe and their color turn to yellow.Majority of the leaves turn yellow or drop when the crop becomes ready for harvesting. Timely harvesting kidney beans is important, because delaying can cause shattering.</p>
                <p>Keep the harvested plants in sun for 3-4 days. And after proper drying, thresh with either sticks or bullocks. Then clean the seeds, and use seed bins for storing the clean seeds.</p>
