            <p>Muskmelon is also called as the Cantaloupe</p>
            <p>The North American cantaloupe (Cucumis melo var. reticulatus) is a vining melon plant that’s easily recognized by the beige netted pattern that forms on the outside of the fruit. It has a tan-green rind and sweet orange flesh. Coarse, medium green heart-shape leaves sit upright on fuzzy stems that line prickly, sprawling vines. Cantaloupe loves warm weather in which to grow, and it has a moderate growth rate. It’s typically planted in the spring for a summer harvest.</p>

                <h1>How to Plant Cantaloupe</h1>
                <p>Cantaloupe grows best in warm temperatures with plenty of space between each plant (at least 18 inches apart). Opt for a spot with full sun and nutrient-rich, acidic to neutral soil with good drainage. Adding compost to the soil will help increase the nutrients for young plants to become established.</p>
                <h3>When to plant</h3>
				<p>In cold climates, it’s best to start seeds indoors approximately four to six weeks prior to your projected last spring frost date. Then, transplant seedlings outdoors once the soil temperature is above 60 degrees Fahrenheit. Likewise, if you live in a warm climate, you can simply plant seeds outdoors once the soil is above 60 degrees Fahrenheit.</p>
                <h3>Selecting a Planting Site</h3>
				<p>Choose a sunny spot with well-drained soil for your cantaloupe. Container growth is an option, though you must have a fairly large container. Avoid growing cantaloupe near watermelon, as they can attract the same pests and diseases. </p>
				<h3>Spacing, Depth, and Support</h3>
				<p>Seeds should be planted roughly an inch deep. Space them 18 inches apart in rows that are around 3 feet apart. A support structure isn’t essential. But you can train the vines to grow up a sturdy trellis or other structure. Not only will this save some ground space, but it also will offer some protection from pests and diseases in the soil. </p>

                <h1>Cantaloupe Plant Care</h1>
                <p><h3>Light</h3> <br/>Cantaloupe needs full sun for healthy growth, meaning at least six hours of direct sun on most days. Sufficient sun also will help to keep the foliage dry, minimizing the chance of fungal diseases.</p>
                <p><h3>Soil</h3><br/>Ideal soil for cantaloupe is a mix of loamy and sandy with a slightly acidic to neutral soil pH. It should have sharp drainage. Consider amending the soil with compost prior to planting to improve both its drainage and nutrient content.</p>
                <p><h3>Water</h3><br/>Ensuring that your cantaloupe plant gets the right amount of water at the right time is one of the most important things for a healthy crop. While the plants are growing, blooming, and setting fruit, they need roughly 2 gallons of water per week. Watering in the morning is preferred to allow leaves to dry off in the afternoon. As the fruit grows, taper the watering. Hot, dry conditions in the final stages of maturation produce the sweetest melons.</p>
                <p><h3>Temperature and Humidity</h3><br/>Temperatures consistently ranging from 70 to 90 degrees Fahrenheit during the growing season will produce the best harvest. The cantaloupe plant isn't frost-tolerant. Plus, temperatures exceeding 90 degrees Fahrenheit can cause flower drop and a poor fruit harvest.

Furthermore, cantaloupe plants prefer higher humidity in their initial growth phase before lowering slightly to around 60 to 70 percent during the flowering and fruit development stages.</p>
                <p><h3>Fertilizer</h3><br/>Feeding is not recommended until a soil test is performed. Excessive nitrogen in the soil can promote foliage growth rather than good fruit production. If you have nutrient-poor soil, adding composted manure when planting and then a balanced organic fertilizer (such as a fish emulsion) every few weeks is common practice. For the amount to use, follow the product label instructions.</p>
                <p><h3>Pollination</h3><br/>Cantaloupe plants produce male and female flowers. And pollinating animals, as well as the wind, help to pollinate them. However, if your vines aren’t fruiting, you always can try hand-pollinating. Remove a male blossom (the ones with the thin stems), take off the petals to reveal the stamen, and then shake the stamen into a female flower to coat it with pollen. Repeat this throughout the vines.</p>

                <h1>Types of Cantaloupe</h1>
                <p>There are several cultivars of cantaloupe available, including:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><b>‘Athena’:</b>This variety takes between 70 and 80 days to mature on average and produces large fruits.</li>
                    <li><b>‘Ambrosia’:</b>This variety is known for its especially sweet flavor.</li>
                    <li><b>‘Hale’s Best Jumbo’:</b>This variety takes between 80 and 90 days to mature on average, and it produces very large fruits</li>
                </ul>

                <h1>Harvesting Cantaloupe</h1>
                <p>Harvest time differs by cantaloupe variety, so be aware of the growth requirements for your particular plant. There are a few key signs that the fruits are ready for harvesting. First, the outside will turn from green to tan. There also should be a crack in the stem where it attaches to the fruit, and the fruit should easily twist off the vine. Fruit that falls off the vine on its own is typically overripe while fruit that’s difficult to remove likely needs more time to ripen. </p
                <p>Gently twist the ripe fruit off of the stem to harvest. Be careful not to disturb the rest of the vine where fruits are still developing. You can store uncut fruits at room temperature for about a week. Cut fruit should be stored in the refrigerator, where it will be at its best for a few days.</p>

                <h1>     Common Pests and Diseases           </h1>
                <p>Cantaloupe is susceptible to some common garden pests and diseases. Pests include aphids, squash vine borer moths, and cucumber beetles. Diseases include powdery mildew and fusarium wilt. Insect infestations can sometimes be treated with neem oil or an organic insecticide. And diseases are best prevented with proper growing conditions. </p>
