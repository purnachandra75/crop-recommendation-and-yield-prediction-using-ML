            <h1>How to Grow Rice </h1>
           <p>It is possible to grow rice at home, but you need to be realistic in your expectations. You won’t be able to harvest enough rice for more than a meal or two even if things go well. Growing a significant crop of rice requires a lot of space, water, and a long, warm growing season. In most areas, this means starting the rice indoors under grow lights.

Growing rice in your backyard or on your porch is a fun project with kids to show them what’s involved in getting a bowl of rice on the dinner table. After growing rice yourself, you’ll better understand the Chinese proverb, “Every grain of rice in your bowl is won by the sweat of the farmer’s brow.”</p>
                <br/>
               

            <P>Watermelons are generally planted from seeds sown directly into the garden as soon as the soil warms to 70 degrees Fahrenheit. In cool regions with short growing seasons, seeds are started indoors two to four weeks before last frost date. Most watermelons take 80 to 90 days to mature, although there are short-season varieties are ready to harvest about 70 days after the seedlings sprout.</P>

                <h1>How to grow rice</h1>
               <p>Rice comes in long-grain, medium- and short-grain textures. It grows easily in your backyard, in a garden bed or in buckets, given the right amount of soil, water, and other nutrients. Short-grain, medium-grain and long-grain rice thrive in wet conditions, specifically standing puddles of water or swamp-like conditions. Once the rice grains develop, the water in which they grow must drain so that you can harvest and mill the crop. After the harvesting and milling processes, you can eat the rice.</p></div>

                <h1>Rice Care</h1>
                <p><h3>Light</h3> <br/>rice require full sunlight in order to thrive. The plants can tolerate some partial shade, particularly in hotter climates, but plenty of sun is necessary to develop the sugars in the melons. Excessively shady conditions will reduce the number and size of the fruits.</p>
                <p><h3>Soil</h3><br/>rice grow well in almost any well-draining rich soil. A mildly acidic to neutral soil pH of 6.0 to 6.8. is best. Heavily amending the soil with plenty of organic matter before planting is advised, as these are heavy feeders.</p>
                <p><h3>Water</h3><br/>rice need regular watering when first transplanted. Once they begin setting fruits, you can ease up on the water, unless it is an especially dry season. Their roots are relatively deep and they can withstand short dry periods. In fact, they will lose sweetness if given too much water.</p>
                <p><h3>Temperature and Humidity</h3><br/>rice prefer hot growing conditions, 80 degrees Fahrenheit and higher. They will do equally well in humid and arid conditions provided soil moisture is adequate.</p>
                <p><h3>Fertilizer</h3><br/>rice are heavy feeders. Make sure your soil is well amended with organic matter before planting. If your soil is lacking in organic matter, add a slow-release organic fertilizer at the start of the season. To keep watermelons growing steadily, side dress at mid-season with a layer of compost.</p>
                <p>If you choose to use chemical fertilizer, feed early with a fertilizer that contains more nitrogen than phosphorus and potassium, since this will encourage the growth of the leaves and vine. But after flowering begins, fertilize a second time with a low-nitrogen fertilizer that encourages growth of flowers and fruit.</p>

                <h1>Rice Varieties</h1>
                <p>There are different types of rices</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><b>'Arborio'</b>
Arborio
Named after the town in Piedmont, Italy, Arborio grains are oval in shape and milky white. The grains have a high amylose content, meaning they release considerable starch during cooking, creating the characteristic creaminess ideal for risotto.</li>
                    <li><b>'Basmati ric'</b> 
Basmati rice
A very long, slender grained aromatic rice grown mainly in the foothills of the Himalayas in India and Pakistan. Sometimes described as the 'Prince of Rice'. It has a fragrant flavour and aroma and is the rice frequently used in Indian dishes. The grains are separate and fluffy when cooked. In Indian recipes it is often cooked with spices to enhance the grain's aromatic properties. Easy cook basmati and brown rice basmati are also available. Brown basmati rice has a higher fibre content and an even stronger aroma than white basmati..</li>
                    <li><b>'Japonica rice'</b>
Japonica rice
Japonica rice is generally short or medium grain. As with long grain indica rice, different varieties have different characteristics. Japonica rice available in the UK originates mainly from Italy and the USA, although other origins are used. It comes in a variety of colours including red, brown and black. It’s used in Japanese and Caribbean cuisines due to its characteristic clingy moist and firm nature when cooked..</li>
                    <li><b>'Ribe'</b>
Ribe
Widely grown in the valley of the river Po in Italy, ribe is a versatile variety suitable for boiling, steaming or pilaf. While it can be used in risottos, it is more suitable for a range of dishes which use liquid such as vegetable soups or minestrones. Ribe is also typically used in rice salads.</li>
               
                    <li><b>'Short grain'</b>Short grain
Short grain rice tends to be almost round and is typically moist when cooked, giving sticky rice which is perfect for desserts and puddings. As well as desserts, short grain rice is also typically used in the preparation of sushi..</li>
                    <li><b>'Vialone nano' </b>

Grown in the province of Verona, Italy, Vialone Nano is another popular risotto rice, which maintains its shape during cooking, while still absorbing liquid, providing the familiar creamy risotto texture. Having been granted a Protected Geographical Indication by the EU, it can only be grown within the 24 municipalities of Verona.</li>

                <h1>Harvesting</h1>
                <p>When the seed heads have dried and turned brown, cut down the entire stalks. Bunch them together and hang to dry for three to four weeks in a dry, well-ventilated place.

The next three steps—threshing, winnowing, and hulling the rice—are very tedious to do manually and require specialized tools. If you get serious about growing your own rice, it’s worth investing in a small scale threshing mach</p>
               
                <p>Watermelons are best eaten right away. Cut watermelon should be refrigerated and only keeps for a few days. Don't store uncut melons in the refrigerator. Opt for a cool room (45 to 50 degrees Fahrenheit), if possible. In this environment, uncut melons will keep for up to two weeks.</p>

                <h1>     Common Pests and Diseases           </h1>
                <p>The biggest watermelon pest is the cucumber beetle. Monitor for the eggs early. If you are using row covers, you will exclude many of them from the vines. Watermelons are also prone to vine borers, aphids, and mites.</p>
                <p>Several diseases can be a problem, including fusarium wilt, anthracnose, alternaria leaf spot, and gummy stem blight. If these diseases are prevalent, choose resistant varieties of watermelon. Watermelons can be prone to powdery mildew, but this is rarely serious—only unsightly. Ground-level watering, rather than overhead watering, will keep soil spores from splashing on the leaves and causing mildew.</p>
