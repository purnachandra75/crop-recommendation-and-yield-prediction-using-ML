            <p>If you're accustomed to purchasing your potatoes (Solanum tuberosum) from the grocery store, chances are you've only tasted a few common varieties. This starchy, round vegetable is a popular addition to meals in many countries, as it is easy to grow and can be prepared in a large variety of recipes. When you grow your own, you can also discover a whole world of flavors, colors, shapes, and sizes you may not be familiar with yet. With hundreds of potato varieties readily available for home gardeners to choose from, growing organic potatoes can help spruce up the ingredients in your kitchen with little effort compared to many other home-grown foods..</p>
            <p>It takes about three to four months for potato plants to reach maturity, depending on the specific variety (some small potatoes can be harvested in just under two months). In southern states, seed potatoes are usually planted in the fall or winter, but those in northern climates should wait until right before the last frost of spring.
                <br/>
                How to Plant Potatoes:</p>
                
                    <ul><li>When to Plant
You should only plant certified disease-free seed potatoes, which are available in garden centers, nurseries, and catalogs (potatoes from the grocery store may be treated with a growth inhibitor). Some varieties of potatoes take longer to harvest than others: Early-season variants typically take about 60 days to reach maturity, while late-season variants can take more than 90 days. In northern regions, choose a planting time based on your potato variety and the average time of your area's last frost.</li></ul>
                    <ul><li>Selecting a Planting Site
Potatoes should be grown in an area that gets at least six hours of sun per day in healthy soil that is acidic and well-drained. Heavy clay soils make it difficult for full-size tubers to form. The planting site should also be a spot in which you have not grown potatoes, tomatoes, peppers, or eggplants for the past two years to prevent the transmission of soil-borne diseases from other plants in the nightshade family.</li></ul>
                    <ul><li>Spacing, Depth, and Support
Small seed potatoes can be planted whole. Those larger than a chicken egg can be cut to retain one to three eyes per piece (though this isn't essential). Make sure that you let any cut seed potatoes sit out for at least 24 hours before planting so the cut sides can callous over and won't rot..</li></ul>
                    <ul><li>In containers, such as barrels, trash cans, or wire enclosures: Place six inches of soil in the bottom, place potatoes on top of the soil, then cover with an additional four inches of soil. Cover any exposed tubers with soil as your potatoes grow until they flower.</li></ul>
                

            <P>Potato are generally planted from seeds sown directly into the garden as soon as the soil warms to 70 degrees Fahrenheit. In cool regions with short growing seasons, seeds are started indoors two to four weeks before last frost date. Most watermelons take 80 to 90 days to mature, although there are short-season varieties are ready to harvest about 70 days after the seedlings sprout.</P>

                <h1>How to Plant Potato</h1>
                <p>  There are several methods for planting potatoes with various guidelines:           </p>
                <p>  Trench-and-hill method: Dig a trench six to eight inches deep, then place potatoes 12 inches apart, eyes facing up. Cover with four inches of soil. As the plant grows, "hill" the soil by adding more on top: Hilling ensures that the tubers stay underground and don't turn green. (Green potatoes are toxic.2
Pei, Diana M. Are Sprouted Potatoes Safe to Eat? Poison Control </p>
<p>Individual hole or "scatter" methods: Dig individual holes six to eight inches deep and wide, place a potato in each hole, then cover it with four inches of soil or mulch. You can also place your potatoes directly on top of the soil before covering (scatter method). Like the trench-and-hill method, continue adding soil or mulch as the plants grow until they flower. Scattering can make your potatoes more susceptible to rodents, so choose whether to dig holes depending on common pests in your area.</p>Keep the area weed-free through the growing season. Gardeners with short seasons should prune off any flowers that form during the last six to seven weeks before the first frost date, as this will encourage the existing fruits to ripen in time. If necessary, row covers can be put in place to protect the plants late in the season.</p>
                <p>In containers, such as barrels, trash cans, or wire enclosures: Place six inches of soil in the bottom, place potatoes on top of the soil, then cover with an additional four inches of soil. Cover any exposed tubers with soil as your potatoes grow until they flower..</p>

                <h1>potatoS Care</h1>
                <p><h3>Light</h3> <br/>Grow your potatoes in full sun, ensuring that they receive at least six hours of direct sunlight per day. Always ensure that the tubers themselves are covered with soil or mulch to avoid turning green. Allow the plant's foliage to soak up plenty of sunlight to feed the potatoes growing underground.</p>
                <p><h3>Soil</h3><br/>Plant potatoes in neutral to acidic soil with organic matter to offer plenty of nutrients. Ensure the soil is well-draining (use a pot with drainage holes if planting in a container). The pH should be between 5.0 and 6.0 for best results—less acidity in the soil can cause rough spots called "scab." Regions with clay soil can still create bountiful harvests, but it's important to prepare it by spreading two to four inches of organic matter in your garden, trench, or planting holes first to increase drainage and aeration..</p>
                <p><h3>Water</h3><br/>Potatoes only require one inch of water per week, but they can be affected by drought if not watered consistently. You can mulch the area to retain more water or utilize an automatic irrigation system when growing larger amounts of potatoes. Be sure that the plants receive plenty of water when flowering to encourage the healthy growth of tubers.</p>
                <p><h3>Temperature and Humidity</h3><br/>In cold climates, wait until the soil temperature has reached 40 to 50 degrees Fahrenheit before planting. Since your potatoes will stop growing once the soil reaches 80 degrees or higher, warm-climate potatoes are best planted in the late summer or late winter. In the southernmost parts of the U.S., it's best to grow your potatoes during the winter (or add a thick layer of mulch above them to cool the soil up to 10 degrees).</p>
                <p><h3>Fertilizer</h3><br/>If you've amended your soil with compost, your potatoes won't require fertilizer. If you haven't been using compost or other organic matter, you can mix a balanced organic fertilizer, diluted liquid fertilizer, or other natural options like fish emulsion into the soil (following the label instructions)..</p>
                <p>If you choose to use chemical fertilizer, feed early with a fertilizer that contains more nitrogen than phosphorus and potassium, since this will encourage the growth of the leaves and vine. But after flowering begins, fertilize a second time with a low-nitrogen fertilizer that encourages growth of flowers and fruit.</p>

                <h1>Types of Potatoes</h1>
                <p>While more than 4,000 types of potatoes exist around the world, there are a few common varieties that you're more likely to encounter as a gardener.3 Here are some popular variants to grow:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><b>'Russet potatoes'</b> are the type that most gardeners in the U.S. are familiar with, featuring a rounded shape and thick, dense feeling to the touch until cooked. 'Norkotah' and 'Burbank' are popular varieties..</li>
                    <li><b>'Red potatoes'</b> grow smaller than russet potatoes and feature a reddish tint to their thin skin. 'Red Pontiac' and 'Viking' are varieties known for their easy growing habits, while 'Chieftan' and 'Norland' varieties are more resistant to potato scab..</li>
                    <li><b>'Yellow potatoes'</b> are versatile for cooking in a wide range of recipes, and their flavor has hints of sweet butter. 'Yukon Gold' is a popular variety in the U.S. that grows with thin skin and no eyes,.</li>
                    <li><b>'Sweet potatoes'</b> have a naturally sweet flavor that makes them a common pick for dessert recipes and spiced seasonings. 'Beauregard' and 'Jewel' are popular varieties for gardeners to grow..</li>
                </ul>

                <p>Several pests are known to infest potato plants, and many can be prevented by covering your potato patch with a floating row cover to help protect them. Common pests and diseases for potatoes include::</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Colorado potato beetle: Handpick beetles, larvae, and eggs from plants.</li>
                    <li>Flea beetles: Keep the area weed-free so you don't provide cover for flea beetles. Spray infested plants with insecticidal soap..</li>
                    <li>Aphids: Monitor the underside of the plant's foliage for eggs. These can be removed by hand or sprayed from the plants with a hose..</li>
                    <li>Scab: Practice crop rotation to avoid transmission, or plant resistant varieties (e.g., 'Norland', 'Chieftain', and 'Russet Burbank').</li>
                </ul>
                <p>Watermelons are best eaten right away. Cut watermelon should be refrigerated and only keeps for a few days. Don't store uncut melons in the refrigerator. Opt for a cool room (45 to 50 degrees Fahrenheit), if possible. In this environment, uncut melons will keep for up to two weeks.</p>
