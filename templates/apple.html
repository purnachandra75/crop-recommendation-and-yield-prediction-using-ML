            <p>Gravenstein apple trees produce edible fruits with a sweet yet tart flavor and are considered one of the best all-around varieties good for cider, baking in pies, apple sauce, and jams. Gravenstein apple trees grow in the Sonoma region of California, preferring damp, loamy, fertile soil and full sun for at least six hours per day. It is also a cold-hardy tree, growing up to 15 feet tall.</p>
            <p>The Gravenstein apple tree will take two to five years to bear fruit. Its fruit will appear in the summer months (typically July and August).

                <h1>Gravenstein Apple Tree Care</h1>
                <p>Here are the main care requirements for growing a Gravenstein apple tree:</p>
                <li>Prefers loamy or sandy, well-draining, but moist soil</li>
				<li>Grows best with at least six hours of full sun</li>
				<li>Handles temperate and cool seasons</li>
				<li>Requires fertilizer for good production</li>

                <p><h3>Light</h3> <br/>The Gravenstein apple tree will grow best in full sun. Be sure to plant your tree in a location with access to at least six hours of direct, unfiltered sunlight daily.</p>
                <p><h3>Soil</h3><br/>Gravenstein apple trees will grow in moderately fertile, damp, and loamy soil. They will thrive in light, sandy-loam soil where its roots can dig deep.</p>
                <p><h3>Water</h3><br/>The Gravenstein apple tree should have access to average moisture while it is established. After that point, they will continue to produce without much irrigation.

However, it would be best to avoid letting the soil dry too much, particularly in summer. Moisture in the air along the coast can contribute to the treeâ€™s growth, even in regions plagued by drought-like conditions.</p>
                <p><h3>Temperature and Humidity</h3><br/>The Gravenstein apple grows well in temperate regions like California but can also tolerate colder temperatures.</p>
                <p><h3>Fertilizer</h3><br/>When fertilizing apple trees, nitrogen-rich fertilizer can be raked evenly into the soil around the base (just be sure to keep it about two feet out and six inches away from the trunk).

The fertilization process can be repeated after three months and should be applied in a three-foot circle around the tree after it is two years old.</p>
                <p><h3>Pollination</h3>Cross-pollination between apple trees is crucial to achieving a good fruit set when growing apples. Cross-pollination of different apple trees must occur at bloom time, so the pollen is transferred from the male part of the flower of one tree to the female part of another. Cross-pollination of apple trees primarily occurs with the help of industrious honeybees. Trees should not be located more than 100 feet apart. Cold, rain, and pesticides affect bee pollination rates.</p>

                <h1>Types of Gravenstein Trees</h1>
                <p>Gravenstein is a triploid apple cultivar and is produced by being cross-pollinated with other self-fertile apples; some common choices include gala, fuji, empire, or red and yellow delicious. Red Gravenstein apples are sports or a naturally occurring genetic mutation formed from a Gravenstein tree, appearing red with juicy flesh.</p>
                <p>Gravenstein, a semi-dwarf variety, is one of the more popular apple tree varieties. It has been cultivated since the 17th century, originating in Denmark, where it is proclaimed the "national apple." It is named for the Graasten estate there.1

                <p>Several diseases can impact apple trees, and Gravenstein apple trees are susceptible to blight, apple scab, and powdery mildew.3 They are also prone to moth damage, but sticky traps can keep pests away from your fruit.</p>
