                    <ul><li>Sugar cane is a tall, clump-forming perennial grass whose long, thick stems are filled with sweet sap. It is mostly grown commercially for foodstuff, including sugar and molasses. In addition, it has also found its way into home gardens as an ornamental. It is used as privacy screen, border, accent, or focal point. Once sugar cane is established, it is a fast grower. The large blades have very sharp edges that require care when handling.</li></ul>
                    <ul><li>In warm climates, it is planted in late summer or fall. In areas where it is not winter-hardy, sugar cane is commonly grown as an annual and planted after the last spring frost.</li></ul>

                <h1>How to Plant Sugarcane</h1>
                <p>It is also possible to grow sugar cane from seeds although that method is less reliable in terms of results and is only recommended if you are planning to grow sugar cane as an edible crop.</p>
                <p>Sow seeds directly in the garden two weeks after the last frost and the soil temperature has reached at least 60 degrees F. </p>
				<p>Plant seeds 1 to 1.5 inches deep, spacing them 8 to 12 inches apart and in rows 36 to 42 inches apart. To ensure wind pollination, plant sugar cane in blocks of at least 3 rows in each direction.</p>
				<p>Keep the soil evenly moist.</p>
				<p>The seeds take about 10 days to germinate. Thin seedlings 8 to 12 inches apart.</p>

                <h1>Sugarcane Care</h1>
                <p><h3>Light</h3> <br/>Sugar cane needs full sun to thrive..</p>
                <p><h3>Soil</h3><br/> (Sugar cane does well in most soil types as long as they are well-drained. It prefers deep soil that crumbles easily, with a pH between 6.0 and 6.5. The plant rapidly saps the nutrients from the ground so plant it in soil that is rich in organic matter or amend the soil with compost.</p>
                <p><h3>Water</h3><br/>Sugar prospers in consistent moisture but does not tolerate wet, soggy soil or being overwatered. In the absence of abundant precipitation, sugar cane needs to be irrigated, 1 to 2 inches of water per week.

However, reduce watering if you plan to harvest mature stems. Slightly dry conditions slow down the growth and increase the sugar production in the lower part of the stalks..</p>
                <p><h3>Temperature and Humidity</h3><br/>Sugar cane flourishes in hot, humid weather. The optimum growing temperature is around 90 degrees F and the relative humidity should be at least 50%. It can't tolerate temperatures below freezing. In temperatures below 70 degrees F, growth is stunted..</p>
                <p><h3>Fertilizer</h3><br/>When grown as a food crop, sugar cane is a heavy feeder and should be given a high-nitrogen fertilizer once a week during its peak growing time in the summer.

However, if you grow it as an ornamental, it is sufficient to fertilize the plant three times during the growing season with a slow-release high-nitrogen fertilizer. Apply the fertilizer 10 inches away from the base of the plant to prevent fertilizer burn.</p>

                <h1>Sugarcane Varieties</h1>
                <p>There are a few fairly common varieties of wheat you can grow, and each variety has qualities making it desirable. The red wheats are some of the most commonly grown in the United States.</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><b>'Pele's Smoke'</b> is a variety with dark purple leaves that turn black with increased sun exposure. It grows up to 8 feet tall. Hardy to the upper end of USDA Zone 8, it is hardier than other varieties.</li>
                    <li><b>'Red Candy Stripe’</b>  has canes with red stripes at the base. With a height of 4 to 6 feet, this is a shorter, fast-maturing variety. If planted in the spring, it is ready to be harvested in the fall.</li>
                    <li><b>‘Hilo Buddha’</b> ‘Hilo Buddha’ is a rare bicolored variety with barrel-shaped nodes that have maroon and lime green stripes..</li>
                    
                </ul>If grown as an ornamental within its zone range, sugar cane typically does not need winter protection. Plants whose canes have been harvested, however, benefit from an extra layer of soil. Cut the plant as close to the ground as possible and cover plant's "stubble" to protect it from cold weather.

Bring container plants indoors before the first fall frost.</p>

            <section>
                <h1>Harvesting</h1>
                <p>To grow sugar cane in a cool climate, you need to grow it in containers and overwinter the plants indoors. Use a container with large drainage holes, about 14 inches deep. Depending on the size of the plant, the container size may range 8 and 20 inches in diameter. Fill it with a mixture of potting soil and compost. Repot it to a larger container with fresh soil when the plant becomes root-bound.

Keeping the soil moist is the biggest challenge of growing sugar cane in pots, as the potting mix dries out faster than garden soil. Up your watering schedule accordingly.</p>

                <h1>     Common Pests and Diseases           </h1>
                <p>Like many other food plants, wheat is susceptible to various pests. One common problem is aphids. An infestation of aphids will slow wheat's growth and affect the appearance of leaves. Usually spraying them with water is effective. You can also use neem oil for more stubborn infestations. Stinkbugs are another common insect problem with wheat. Careful weeding is a good way to avoid attracting them. You can also use food-grade diatomaceous earth mixed into the soil surface to help eliminate them. Some insects lay eggs on wheat, like armyworms. You can use Bacillus thuringiensis (Bt) applied according to product directions to get rid of them.

There are various diseases that can be problems for wheat also. Powdery mildew can occur in periods of high humidity. Watering carefully can help prevent this; watering at the base of the plant helps cut down on unnecessary humidity. Ergot fungus can also form in humid conditions, and this is potentially toxic if consumed. This is identifiable by the black or dark purple color of the grain when this fungus is present. Wheat mosaic virus causes yellow discoloration and curling of leaves. Diseases present in your wheat crop requires the removal of affected plants to prevent the disease from spreading, and discarding them effectively away from the garden (don't put them in your compost heap).</p>
