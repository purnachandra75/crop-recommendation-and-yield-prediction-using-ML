            <p>Growing horse gram is especially popular in India. But it is one of the lesser known beans in most other parts of the world.As the name suggests, horse gram is generally used to feed horses. But it is also commonly used in cooking. It is considered as a food with medicinal qualities in traditional Ayurvedic cuisine.Horse gram is actually a short day, twining, succulent, annual climbing herb. The plants have trifoliate leaves, white flowers, long linear pubescent pods with curved beak, flattened small seeds with light red, brown, grey, black or mottled testa with photo and thermo-sensitive nature.</p>

                <h1>How to Plant horse gram</h1>
                <p>The horse gram plants are very hardy and drought tolerant. They generally require less care and management.If you are planning for growing horse gram, don’t worry! It’s really very easy.Here we are describing more information about growing horse gram from planting, caring to harvesting</p>
                <h3>select a location</h3>
				<p>The horse gram plants grow well in almost all types of soil. But they prefer well-drained and fertile soil which is rich in lots of organic contents.The plants are relatively tolerant to low to moderate salinity levels with pH up to 8.They can grow in soil with heavy metal stresses, compared to other pulse crops grown in semi-arid regions.The horse gram plants are completely intolerant of frost and they are sensitive to becoming waterlogged.The plants also prefer access to full sun. So consider all these factors while choosing a site for growing horse gram.</p>
                <h3>Planting</h3>
				<p>You can plant horse gram seeds either by scattering throughout the field or in rows. But we recommend planting horse gram seeds in rows, and it will make the caring process much easier.</p>

                <h1>horse gram Care</h1>
                <p><h3>mulching</h3> <br/>Mulching helps to retain moisture into the soil, and also helps to prevent most of the weeds. So try to mulch when the seedlings appear and reach few inches height. Try to use organic materials for mulching such as straw, hay, grass clippings, dried leaves or compost.</p>
                <p><h3>Soil</h3><br/>The horse gram plants grow well in well-drained and fertile soil which is rich in organic contents.So while preparing the soil, till it first and then add as much organic contents as you can into the soil. Homemade compost, quick compost and well-rotted aged manure will be very good for using for this purpose.For commercial horse gram production, add at least 5-6 tonnes of organic contents per acre. And also add 60-65 kg of super phosphate and 20-22 kg of urea (nitrogen) per acre.</p>
                <p><h3>Water</h3><br/>The horse gram plants are highly drought tolerant plants. Although you should monitor the field regularly both for water stress or drought conditions, for producing quality seeds and also for maximum yield. You should keep the soil moist and water frequently but lightly during the initial growth stage of the plants. Ensure to water the plants, especially at the time of flowering, pod forming and seed development stages.</p>
                <p><h3>Temperature and Humidity</h3><br/>The horse gram plants grow well in warm and dry climatic conditions. The plants are extremely drought tolerant and they require less care.Although the plants can’t grow well on higher altitudes, mainly because of wet and cool climate (the plants can be grown up to an altitude of 1000 meter above the sea level).Relative humidity between 50 and 80 percent is optimum for the growth of these plants. And temperature ranging between 25 °C and 30 °C is ideal (the plants can tolerate up to 40 °C temperature, but the growth rate declines remarkably below 20 °C.And for successful cultivation of horse gram, a well-distributed rainfall of about 800 mm is sufficient. Although the plants can perform very well even under low rainfall areas.</p>
                <p><h3>Fertilizer</h3><br/>Contact your local agriculture department and test the soil to know whether you need to apply additional fertilizers. In most cases, if you prepare the soil by following the above mentioned method, them you don’t have to apply additional fertilizers.</p>
                <p><h3>Controlling weeds</h3><br/>Weeds consume nutrients from the soil. So controlling them is important. You can control weeds either by hands or by hoeing. But be very careful while hoeing, because the horse gram plants have very shallow roots.</p>
