            <p>Barley (Hordeum vulgare), a member of the grass family, is a major cereal grain grown in temperate climates globally. It was one of the first cultivated grains; it was domesticated in the Fertile Crescent around 9000 BC, giving it nonshattering spikelets and making it much easier to harvest. Its use then spread throughout Eurasia by 2000 BC. Barley prefers relatively low temperatures to grow, and well-drained soil. It is relatively tolerant of drought and soil salinity, but is less winter-hardy than wheat or rye.</p>

                <h1>How to Grow Barley</h1>
                <p>Barley goes through several developmental phases during its growth cycle. The first phase is germination, where the seed begins to sprout and grow roots. The next phase is tillering, where the plant begins to grow multiple stems from the base of the plant. After tillering, the plant enters the stem elongation phase, where the stems begin to grow taller. Finally, the plant enters the ripening phase, where the grains begin to mature and the plant is ready for harvest.</p>
                <p>Before planting barley, there are several crucial steps that must be taken to ensure a successful crop. In this section, we will cover the soil requirements, selecting quality seeds, and optimal sowing date.</p>
                <p>Selecting high-quality seeds is essential for a successful crop. It is important to choose seeds that are certified and free from diseases. The seed rate will depend on the variety of barley being planted and the desired plant population. Typically, a seed rate of 100-120 kg per hectare is recomme</p>
				<p>When it comes to planting barley, there are a few key factors that beginner farmers need to keep in mind. In this section, we will cover the sowing techniques, row spacing and depth, and water and irrigation requirements for growing barley successfully.</p><div style="background-color: aqua;"><p><h3>Tip:</h3></p></div>

                <p><h3>Water</h3><br/>Barley requires adequate moisture to grow properly. The soil should have some moisture during the germination period, which typically lasts between 7 and 10 days. After the plants have emerged, monitor the soil moisture levels, so the plants don’t suffer drought- although in the UK it is usually not an issu</p>

                <ul>
                    <li><b>'Barley Flakes'</b>	


If barley ﬂakes remind you of oatmeal (rolled oats), it’s because they’re created the same way, by steaming kernels, rolling them, and drying them. As with barley grits, ﬂakes can be made from whole grain barley or from pearl barley, with only the former considered to be whole grains. Barley ﬂakes cook faster, because they’ve been lightly steamed and because of their greater surface area.</li>
                    <li><b>'Barley Grits'</b>When barley kernels are cut into several pieces, they become grits. Read the label carefully: grits from hulled or hulless barley are whole grain, but grits created by cutting up pearl barley are not considered whole grain.</li>
                    <li><b>'Hulless Barley'</b>This type of barley has an outer hull that’s so loosely attached to the kernel that it generally falls oﬀ during harvesting. This cuts down on processing and ensures that all of the bran and germ are retained.</li>
                    <li><b>'Barley,'</b>This is what barley looks like as it grows in the ﬁeld. Most barley is what’s called “covered barley,” which means it has a tough, inedible outer hull around the barley kernel. This covering must be removed before the barley can be eaten. A less common variety, referred to as “naked” barley, has a covering, or hull, that is so loose that it usually falls oﬀ during harvesting.</li>

                <h1>Harvesting</h1>
                <p>Barley crop gets ready for harvest by the end of March to first fortnight of April in different areas. Barley spikes are susceptible to shattering, therefore crop should be harvested when it matures to avoid breakage of spikes due to dryness on over maturity and in case of harvest with combines to avoid grain breakage</p>

                <h1>     Common Pests and Diseases           </h1>
                <p>Major diseases of barley crop are Loose Smut, Covered Smut, Rusts and blight. Among the pest’s aphids may cause considerable damage if not controlled. In some areas of Rajasthan and Haryana Molya disease (caused by cereal cyst nematodes) also occurs. 

The occurrence of disease takes place due to the use of non-resistant varieties, weather conditions and area of cultivation. Therefore, always improved varieties with disease resistance should be used. A few pests and diseases can be controlled through seed treatment. For others, you must contact your nearest agricultural department for the management of diseases and pests. </p>
