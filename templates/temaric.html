                    <ul><li>Turmeric is a tropical perennial plant grown for its edible, deep orange-yellow rhizomes that add flavor, color, and nutritional value to a wide variety of dishes. The rhizomes, which are often referred to as turmeric roots, are used fresh or dried and ground as a spice. Turmeric is in the same plant family as ginger. .</li></ul>
                    <ul><li> While it is primarily grown for culinary purposes, the canna-like flowers make turmeric an attractive foliage plant. If grown in ideal conditions, the plant produces flower stems with showy bracts in late summer.

Turmeric is planted in the spring..</li></ul>

			<h1>How to Grow Turmeric in Pots</h1>
                <h1>Growing turmeric in a pot indoors is recommended below zone 8 because it allows you to easily move it outdoors for the summer and back indoors for the winter.</h1>
                <p>Fill a large container or a grow bag with slightly damp, well-draining potting mix.</p>
                <p>If the rhizomes look dry and shriveled, soak them in tepid water for 24 hours.</p>
				<p>Cut large rhizomes with many buds into 1- to 3-inch pieces so that each piece has at least two to three buds..</p>
				<p>Plant one piece of rhizome in each container, about 2 inches deep and with the buds pointing up.</p>
				<p>Mist daily until you see sprouts emerging. After sprouting, move to a routine of daily watering, water enough so the soil never dries out.</p>
				<p>Once the outdoor temperature remains consistently above 70 degrees F during the day and does not drop below 50 degrees F at nighttime, move the pot outdoors and put it in a sunny spot that is sheltered from high winds.</p>
				<p>As potted plants dry out much faster outdoors, increase the watering. In hot, dry weather mist the leaves.</p>

                <h1>Temeric Care</h1>
                <p><h3>Light</h3> <br/>In cooler northern locations, turmeric grows best in full sun. In southern climates, it benefits from partial sun, especially during the hot afternoon hours.</p>
                <p><h3>Soil</h3><br/>Turmeric likes a rich soil. Adding compost and/or manure helps achieve this. The soil should also drain well.</p>
                <p><h3>Water</h3><br/>The water needs of the plant vary depending on the growth stage. After planting and until the rhizomes sprout, water it moderately; at this point, turmeric does not absorb a lot of water yet and overwatering leads to root rot. Once it starts growing, water it regularly in the absence of sufficient rain to keep the soil consistently moist but not soggy..</p>
                <p><h3>Fertilizer</h3><br/>Turmeric requires regular fertilization during the growing season in the spring and summer. Feed it with a complete, balanced water-soluble fertilizer, such as 10-10-10, once a month. For the amount to use, follow product label instructions.</p>
                <p></p>

            <section>
              <p>If you spot a brown leaf or two, simply prune it out using a clean cutting tool. Brown leaves may mean the plant needs more water. However yellowing, dying leaves are normal when the plant is going into dormancy in the winter.</p>

            <section>
                <h1>Harvesting</h1>
                <p>In the fall or early winter, after the foliage has started to yellow and fade, carefully dig out some of the rhizomes. Leave at least a portion of each rhizome in the ground; it will regrow next spring.

Unpeeled fresh turmeric keeps in a plastic bag in the refrigerator for several weeks. For longer storage, freeze or dry it to grind it into a powder afterward.</p>

            <section>
                <h1>     Common Pests and Diseases           </h1>
                <p>Turmeric is not prone to get serious pests or diseases. When the soil is too dry, spider mites may appear. Spray them away with water or use insecticidal soaps. Slugs and snails like to snack on the plant's young leaves, which may necessitate some form of control.

Soil and overwatered soil lead to soft rot, dry rot, Fusarium rot, and rhizome rot.</p>
