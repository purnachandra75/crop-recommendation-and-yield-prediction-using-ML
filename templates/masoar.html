			<p>The lentil plant is an annual, a legume, and a member of the Fabaceae family, like peas or beans. Plants grow on branched vines averaging 12 to 24 inches tall. This slender, semi-erect plant can be grown with a single stem or free to grow in a branched bush. White, light purple, or pale blue flowers bloom on the lowest branches and move up the plant until harvest. Flowers fade about three days after bloom and produce seed pods three to four days later..</p>
            <P>Each flat, smooth seed pod is half to a quarter of an inch long and contains one or two seeds. These cool-season legumes grow relatively fast. Plant them in spring, and they should be ready for harvest after about 80 days.</p>

                <h1>How to Plant Masoar</h1>
                <p>Lentils are easy to grow and very hardy. Sow the lentil seeds in late April to early May, three weeks before the last frost date. Young plants can tolerate light frost. Plants will likely be shorter if sown later, and pods will mature later and less prolificall</p>
                <p>Plant the seeds 1 to 2 inches deep—space one inch between seeds and 18 to 24 inches between rows. Give growing plants a short trellis; if no support is added, space plants 5 inches apart so the air can circulate between them. Lentils don't compete well with weeds.</p>

                <h1>Masoar Care</h1>
                <p><h3>Light</h3> <br/>Select a location that gets full sun, preferably on the south or east, where the sun is warmest and will encourage little seedlings to grow quickly.</p>
                <p><h3>Soil</h3><br/>Overall, lentils adapt to all soil types, but good drainage is critical. Plants prefer sandy loam soils that are well-drained and fertile. Avoid saline, boron, or sodic soils, which may limit root growth and the plant's ability to intake moisture. A pH of 6.0 and 6.5 is best (though the plants will grow in a soil pH of up to 8.0)..</p>
                <p><h3>Water</h3><br/>Upon planting, water well without making the soil soggy. Give plants about 1 inch of water per week. At least 10 inches of annual rainfall is needed. If weather conditions become especially dry, lentil plants are drought tolerant. However, the plants may die if the soil becomes waterlogged. Stop watering when pods begin to dry.

</p>
                <p><h3>Temperature and Humidity</h3><br/>Lentil plants thrive in areas where the weather is cool and with limited rainfall, such as eastern Washington, northern Idaho, and western Canada, among other locations in North America. Ideal temperatures are around 65 to 85 degrees Fahrenheit, and the humidity should be on the lower side—30 to 40 percent is ideal.</p>
                <p><h3>Fertilizer</h3><br/>You don't need fertilizer; use compost and tea to enrich the soil. If your soil is naturally clumpy, add compost to loosen it in the fall before spring planting, as direct contact with fertilizer may shock the seeds. Before you plant the seeds, use an inoculant to boost the plant's nitrogen. </p>

				<h1>Masoar Varieties</h1>
				 <p>Types Masoar</p>
				<p>Lentils are divided into two subspecies: the cultivated variety (Lens culinaris) featured in this guide and its wild relative (Lens orientalis). The seed coat of lentils can be clear, green, pale tan, brown or black; some cultivars have purple, black mottles or speckles. There are many varieties, here are a few:</p>
				<ul>
                    <li><b>'Brewer::'</b>Large, brown, most common variety</li>
                    <li><b>'Green Eston:'</b> Green, smaller than other lentils .</li>
					<li><b>'Masoor':</b>Red seed, brown coat</li>
					<li><b>'Avondale':</b> A medium-sized green lentil; large yield; another common variety in the United State</li>
					<li><b>'Beluga':</b>Black variety; so named because it looks like caviar</li>
                </ul>

            <section>
                <h1>Harvesting</h1>
				<p>Collect green pods within 70 to 80 days of planting to eat them like snap beans. Harvest lentils when the lower pods are brown in late July and early August. The seed is called a pulse when lentils are used as a dry grain.</p>
                </ul>
            </section>
            <section>
                <h1>     Common Pests and Diseases           </h1>
                <p>Because lentil plants thrive in low humidity, they usually do not attract many diseases. Occasionally blight, white mold, or root rot may occur as a symptom of rotating lentils with the wrong crops.

In addition to wheat, corn is another good option for crop rotation. Rotate every three or four years. Avoid fava bean, field bean, field pea, mustard, canola, rapeseed, soybean, sunflower, sugar beet, and potato because they are susceptible to some of the same diseases.</p>
<p>Pests are minimal too. It is very rare for lentils to attract lygus bugs, aphids, maggots, wireworms, and thrips. If you notice them, hose them down with a steady stream of water or pinch them off.</p>
