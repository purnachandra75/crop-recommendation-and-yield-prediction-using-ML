                <h1>How to plant mungo</h1>
                <p>Growing green gram is very easy. And you can start growing green gram, even if you are a beginner.Here we are describing more information about growing green gram from planting, caring to harvesting</p>
                <p><h3>Select a location</h3><br/>First of all, you have to select a good location for growing green gram. The green grams can be grown almost everywhere, but they grow very well in well-drained soil with the availability of full sun.</p>
                <p><h3>Prepare the soil</h3><br/>The green gram plants can be grown on a wide range of soil types. But well-drained, loamy to sandy-loam soils is considered good for growing green gram. Saline and water logged soils are not good for green gram cultivation.2-3 ploughing is required for preparing the soil and bringing the soil to fine tilth. Carry out planking after each ploughing. Try to remove the weeds from the field while preparing the soil.Apply all the fertilizers while ploughing or tilling the soil. For commercial production, apply about 10-12 kg urea and 80-100 kg super phosphate per acre while preparing the soil.</p>
				<p><h3>Planting</h3><br/>You can either scatter the seeds throughout the field, or plant in rows. For planting in rows, mark several rows in the soil after leveling it.Space the rows to about 10-12 inches apart. The sow seeds to about 4 inches apart for Kharif crop, and about 3 inches apart for summer season crop.Sow the seeds to about 1 inch deep. Drill/pora/kera methods can be used for sowing the seeds.Treat the seeds with fungicide or insecticide before sowing them into the field.You can treat the seeds with Captan or Thiram at the rate of 3 grams per kg seeds. Light watering after sowing the seeds will help to germinate the seeds faster.</p>

                <h1>mungo bean Care</h1>
                <p><h3>controlling weeds</h3> <br/>Weeds consume nutrients from the soil. So you should always try to keep your crop field free from weeds. You should remove the weeds from the soil during ploughing for the first time. And control additional weeds by hoeing if you notice any. First hoeing should be done 4 weeks after sowing the seeds, and second hoeing 2 weeks later after first hoeing.</p>
                
                <p><h3>Water</h3><br/>The green gram is mainly grown as a Kharif crop. Depending upon the climatic conditions, water the plants if needed. 3-4 irrigation is required for summer season crop, depending upon soil type and climatic conditions. Excessive watering can damage the yield. So stop watering 55 days after sowing the seeds.</p>
                
                <p><h3>Fertilizer</h3><br/>In most cases, you donâ€™t have to apply additional fertilizers for growing green gram.</p>

                <h1>Harvesting</h1>
                <p>You should start harvesting when about 85 percent of the pods are fully matured. Try to to avoid bad conditions for harvesting. And you should not wait for getting all the pods riped.Avoid over-ripening of the pods, because you will loose many of the seeds if the pods are too much riped.You can either cut the entire plant or the stalks which are bearing the seeds. And bring them home after cutting, and keep in open space for sun drying.And after drying, you should thresh either biting by stick or by using a machine. Clean and sun dry the seeds after threshing.</p>

                <h1>     Common Pests and Diseases           </h1>
                <p>Stem fly is the main pest found in this crop. Stem flies affect the plant at the early stages, leading to drying and withering.Yellow mosaic disease can be observed during the growth stages of this crop.However, you should always keep good contact with any expert or agriculture specialist.And ask him/her for help if you notice any pests or diseases in your crop field, and take necessary steps as soon as you can.</p>
