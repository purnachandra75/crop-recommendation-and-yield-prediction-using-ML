            <h1> </h1>
            <p>Chili peppers and hot sauces are commonplace everywhere from snack foods to diner booths. The competition to produce the hottest pepper results in new varieties coming to the market every few years. Whether your tastes run to just a little heat or a pepper that makes your eyes water, there are dozens of varieties to choose from, which helps make chili peppers popular around the world.</p>
            <p>If you're a chili pepper fan who enjoys some sweet with the heat you might try growing Thai pepper plant (Capsicum annuum 'Bird's Eye'). It grows thick-walled fruits 1 to 2 inches long and full of seeds. They ripen from green to red at maturity with a Scoville rating of 50,000 to 100,000. With a sweetness similar to a red bell pepper, they're very hot but not fiery as a habanero.

At about 1 foot tall, the Thai pepper plant grows well in containers. Some of the dozens of pepper varieties are sold as ornamentals which also are edible. This is a chili pepper with a long growing season, 100 to 130 days, that produces best in plenty of hot, humid weather.</p>

                <h1>How to Plant Thai Pepper Plant</h1>
                <p>To successfully grow and harvest these small, prolific peppers you need to provide day time temperatures of 75 to 80 degrees F. and a lengthy gardening season of at least 100 days.</p>
                <h3>When to plant</h3>
				<p>Gardeners in hardiness zones 9 to 11 can direct sow seed when soil has warmed to 60 degree F. Otherwise, start seeds indoor 8 to 10 weeks before the final frost date in your growing zone.</p>
                <h3>Selecting a Planting Site</h3>
				<p>Choose a spot that receives full sun, 6 to 8 hours daily, with rich, well draining soil. Amend with compost or other nitrogen rich organic material. Avoid spots where other nightshade plants were grown the previous year.</p>
				<h3>Spacing, Depth, and Support</h3>
				<p>Transplant seedlings 1 to 2 feet apart in rows 2 to 3 feet apart. Remove seed leaves and set seedlings in planting holes at or slightly lower than the level in their current container. In raised beds seedlings can be planted 14 to 16 inches apart.

With a mature height of 1 foot, Thai pepper plants don't require support.</p>

                <h1>Thai Pepper Plant Care</h1>
                <p><h3>Light</h3> <br/>This hot pepper plant thrives in hot sun and needs direct sunlight a minimum of 6 hours daily. More is even better. Avoid planting near taller plants that block light.</p>
                <p><h3>Soil</h3><br/>Thai pepper plant prefers rich, well-draining soil with a slightly acidic to balanced pH of 5.5 to 7.0. Work aged compost or manure into soil before planting.</p>
                <p><h3>Water</h3><br/>Deep, thorough watering every two to three days keeps soil moist without waterlogging. When fruits are in the immature green phase be careful of overwatering but don't let soil become bone dry. Drip irrigation is ideal for keeping Thai pepper plant well hydrated.</p>
                <p><h3>Temperature and Humidity</h3><br/>This hot pepper requires steady heat of 70 to 85 degrees F, daily and 60 to 70 degrees at night. Nighttime temperatures outside this range can reduce your yield. Humidity levels of 50 to 60 percent are adequate as long as it still gets intense light and moist soil.</p>
                <p><h3>Fertilizer</h3><br/>Fertilize Thai pepper plant a month after planting out with an NPK 5-10-10. When fruit starts to set feed a second time with a product that includes calcium. Once plants are established, avoid nitrogen rich fertilizers which can inhibit fruit production. Tomato fertilizers work well for pepper plants.</p>
                <p></p>

                <h1>Types of Thai Pepper Plants</h1>
                <p>Thai pepper plant includes 79 identified varieties, but classifications are a bit confusing depending on where they are grown, Here are several hot peppers comparable in size and heat.</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><b>'Serrano, Capsicum annuum:'</b>Ripe fruits are scarlet red, cylindrical, and 1 to 2 inches long. Thick fleshed with clean, biting heat, Three serranos equal the heat of one Thai pepper.</li>
                    <li><b>'Tabasco, Capsicum frutescens:'</b>Thin, bright orange-red fruits 1 to 1 1/2 inches long are thin-walled with a sharp, biting flavor.</li>
                    <li><b>'Korean, Capsicum annuun:'</b> Cousin to Thai pepper, this chile is bright green, slightly curved and thin fleshed. Korean hot peppers measure 3 to 4 inches and taper to a point.</li>
                    <li><b>'Cayenne, Capsicum annuum:'</b>Most often used dried, cayenne peppers are thin, 2 to 4 inches long and taper to a point. Ripe fruits feature bright red color and tart, smoky flavor.</li>
                </ul>
                
            </section>
            <section>
                <h1>Harvesting</h1>
                <p>Thai peppers are harvested in both the green and red stages. Wait until green peppers reach full size before picking. Green peppers will have lower heat levels and not have the same flavor as a fully ripe red pepper. Use a snipper to remove peppers from the plant to keep stems intact. Stemless peppers deteriorate quickly after being cut.</p>
                <div style="background-color: aqua;"><p><h3>Tip:</h3>Peppers continue to ripe on their own after harvest. Place them in a warm room and check every few days for any that may need to be discarded. They generally ripen fully in about two weeks.</p></div>
				<div style="background-color:aqua;"><p><h3>Companion Plants for Thai Pepper:</h3>Thai pepper works well as a companion plant. Try planting it with nasturtium, marigold, petunia, chive, oregano, dill, basil, and parsley.</p>

                <h1>     Common Pests and Diseases           </h1>
                <p>Thai pepper plant attracts a number of sap-sucking insects like aphids and spider mites. When discovered early, these pests can be knocked down with a strong spray from a hose. Treat infestations with a mild soap and water solution.</p>
				<p>The most significant pest, especially in the southern U.S., is the pepper weevil. It lays eggs in flowers and developing peppers. The larvae then tunnel through all parts of the plant, ruining the fruit. Once fruits are breached, insecticides won't fix it. Remove and dispose of any fallen fruit. Practice good garden sanitation and crop rotation, avoiding areas where solanaceous plants have been grown the previous two years.</p>
				<p>Thai pepper is also vulnerable to fungal, bacterial and viral diseases. They include verticilllium and bacterial wilts, bacterial and cercospora leaf spot, powdery mildew, and pepper and tobacco mosaic viruses.Treating affected plants with appropriate fungicides can help manage some issues; inorganic controls generally are ineffective against viral infection.Reduce the likelihood of these problems by providing the best possible growing conditions and using disease-resistant seeds.</p>
