           <p>A farmer’s most important job is maintaining the soil’s fertility as healthy soil can result in excellent crop production. Thus, the following are seven essential tips that might help you improve soil fertility. </p> 
            <h3><b>1. Summer ploughing:</b></h3>
            <p>Usually done in the summer when the field is empty, ploughing the farms across the slope has many advantages for the soil since it allows for aeration, reduces erosion, and increases the soil’s ability to retain water. Additionally, it destroys the eggs, larvae, and pupae of pests and the fungus growing on the field.</p>
            <h3><b>2. Regular Soil Testing</b></h3>
            <p>Regular soil testing can educate you on the nutrients lacking in your soil and the crops that will grow best there. In addition, knowing the actual state of your soil will enable you to provide it with the nutrients it needs to keep the balance of nutrients.</p>
